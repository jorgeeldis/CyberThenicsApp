# CyberThenics

> Where we teach you calisthenics the retro way!

The goal of cyberthenics is to encourage people to start working out without any equipment, and what better way to do this than with calisthenics! This app has a "game" theme that helps you progress by reaching new levels and completing new skills, we gather as much information as possible to know what is the best way to be motivated while working out, and many people told us the best way was to upgrade "levels and skills", so that's why we do it! This app is for beginners, intermediate and advanced people, remember to go step by step and have a correct form while you do your exercises so you don't get an injury!
